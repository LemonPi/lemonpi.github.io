	I'm a first year Robotics PhD student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
</p>

<p>
    I grew up in China, immigrated to Canada when I was 8,
    stayed in Calgary for 10 years, did my undergrad in Toronto
    for 4 years, spent 16 months in Zurich, and now I'm in
    Ann Arbor.
</p>
    
<p>
	In my spare time, I enjoy making reusable tools, freely available on my <a href="https://github.com/LemonPi">github</a>, and
	participating in various programming competitions.
