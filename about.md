<p>
	I'm a third year Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto in the Robotics option.
	In my spare time, I like making high quality reusable tools, which can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/LemonPi">github</a>.
	I enjoy general problem solving, especially those with a <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">mathematical tint</a>, and participate
	in various <a href="res/ieee.jpg">programming competitions</a>. 
</p>
<p>
	My projects generally involve language parsing, such as 
	<a href="projects/bincalc/#second/">binc (binary calculator)</a> and
	<a href="projects/clisp/">clisp (lisp interpreter)</a>.
	My summer research includes optimizing <a href="https://github.com/verilog-to-routing/vtr-verilog-to-routing">CAD for FPGA routing</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Programming languages and me:<br>
	<strong>C++</strong> - my favourite and most proficient language because of its generality and efficiency<br>
	<strong>Python</strong> - my goto scripting language for its simplicity<br>
	<strong>Haskell</strong> - the language I admire the most for its elegance (yet still cannot use very well)<br>
	<strong>Javascript</strong> - the necessary evil of web development<br>
	<strong>C</strong> - goto for embedded<br>
	<strong>Java</strong> - the language I despise the most yet I still sometimes use<br>
