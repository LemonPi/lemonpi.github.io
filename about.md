<p>
	I'm a third year Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto in the Robotics option.
	Currently, I'm on a 16 month internship at <a href="http://veritystudios.com/">Verity Studios</a>,
	a drone based startup in Switzerland with some of the best minds in Robotics.

	In my spare time, I make high quality reusable tools, freely available on my <a href="https://github.com/LemonPi">github</a>.
	I enjoy general problem solving, especially those with a <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">mathematical tint</a>, and participate
	in various <a href="res/ieee.jpg">programming competitions</a>. 
</p>
<p>
	Programming languages (most proficient first)<br>
	<strong>C++</strong> - the reliable hammer that can be effectively applied to almost any nail<br>
	<strong>Javascript</strong> - a surprisingly beautiful language and probably the most misunderstood<br>
	<strong>Python</strong> - combined with matplotlib, the best language for churning out graphics<br>
	<strong>C</strong> - goto for embedded<br>
	<strong>Java</strong> - the language I despise the most<br>
	<strong>Haskell</strong> - an elegant tool, admirable for how it can teach functional thinking<br>
