Collected here are my assessment and guideline on technical tools and teamwork strategies.
Each tool will be analyzed as to what they're <p class="text pro-text">suited for and when to use them</p>, 
and when <p class="text con-text">they're not useful</p> is discussed, 
and the tool is assigned a <p class="text score-text">general usefulness score</p> based on the range of situations the tool would be helpful in.
<br>
Teamwork strategies examine aspects of teamwork and potential causes of problems inside each and how they can be dealt with.

These are the tools I use to solve the right problem and solve the problem right.
To solve the right problem, research and reframing has to be done to refine a better understanding of what the actual problem is.
And to solve the problem right, the other tools allow me to create a modular solution whose components can be easily interchanged.
I believe this to be more important than having a perfect monolithic solution since a modular design is adaptable to a changing
environment and can be made better through iteration and alteration of parts.

###Functional decomposition

				<li>easier to focus on specific part of problem
				<li>forces consideration of what the actual problem is
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="con-box">
			<ul>
				<li>approximates problem since in reality all parts are interdependent

###Reframing problem

				reframed to selecting for a corrosive resistent and easy to clean material,

These are the aspects of that are likely to cause problems. For each I will examine the <p class="text cause-text">causes</p>
and <p class="text remedy-text">remedies</p>.
The top box will cover causes while the bottom box covers remedies.
</div>

<a name="meetings"> </a>
###Meetings
<div class="team-box">
	<div class="cause-box">
		<ul>
			<li>meetings without a clear purpose lead to unproductive time spent together, 
			fostering animosity between teammates and a hostile atmosphere
			<li>meetings <b>were too frequent</b>, leading to members skipping
			<li>members relied on meeting time to do their work
			<li>all these cripple a team's ability to do parallel work, making a team pointless
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="remedy-box">
		<ul>
			<li>make clear that meeting time is only to distribute work rather than do it
			<li>make a simple checklist of things to accomplish at each meeting (be realistic)
			<li>only hold full meetings at critical points
			<ol>
				<li>first contact, establish expectations and distribute tasks 
				<li>decide on which solution to prototype
				<li>before presentation 
				<li>decide on major alteration
			</ol>
			<li>allow room for asynchronous decision making (via facebook group or google docs), rather than requiring everyone
			to be present for all decisions
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

<a name="unperformant"> </a>
###Unperformant Team Members
<div class="team-box">
	<div class="cause-box">
		<ul>
			<li><b>different expectations</b> from the start on what is a good job
			<li>not assigning tasks to members' strengths or giving them minor tasks that demonstrate your lack of trust
			<li>hostile team environment 
			<li>communication issues and incompetence
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="remedy-box">
		<ul>
			<li>use the first meeting to set up expectations
			<li>take a chance with new teammates by trusting them to important tasks
			<li>maintain friendly atmosphere by keeping meetings infrequent and informal, as well as making personal connections
			<li>problem should resolve itself since reputation has a natural feedback cycle -->
			hardworkers will develop a hardworking reputation and will more likely select other hardworkers as future teammates
			while freeloaders become publicly known and are avoided
			<li>only way in dealing with current unperformant team is to take up more work yourself
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

<a name="atmosphere"> </a>
###Team Atmosphere
<div class="team-box">
	<div class="cause-box">
		<ul>
			<li>depends on 
			<ol>
				<li>frequency and formality of meetings
				<li>past success
				<li>personal interactions
			</ol>
			<li>best established during first meeting
			<li>upkeeping is much easier than changing it
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="remedy-box">
		<ul>
			<li>hold full meetings only when necessary
			<li>keep communication fluid (ex. facebook group, google docs) rather than static (only at meetings, either skype or in person)
			<li>avoid working with previous unperformant members
			<li>fix up bad social habits (ex. always being skeptical of others' ideas)
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

<a name="parallel"> </a>
###Parallel Tasks
<div class="team-box">
	<div class="cause-box">
		<ul>
			<li>purpose of team is to accomplish a large task faster and better by division of tasks
			<li>serializing tasks indicate failing team
			<li>team relies on meetings to get work done
			<li>distribution of dependent tasks
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="remedy-box">
		<ul>
			<li>use functional decomposition at each step to create independent subproblems
			<li>visually render tasks, either informally or formally through a Gantt chart
		</ul>
	</div>
