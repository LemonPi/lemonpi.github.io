    <p>
        For 12 weeks during the summer of 2018
        I worked at <a href="http://www.keplercommunications.com/">Kepler Communications</a>
        as a software engineering intern.

        I designed and implemented the mission control software backend
        to replace a third party solution which was not scalable and had usability issues.

    <p>
        Kepler works with low earth orbit satellites that orbit around Earth very quickly.
        Communication is only possible when they're visible to a ground station, usually
        lasting around 10 minutes each with many hour gaps in between.
        These opportunities are called <strong>passes</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The link quality increases as the altitude of the satellite relative to the ground
        station increases, up to a maximum in the middle of the pass. Packets are frequently
        lost, especially when the altitude is low.

        The MCS backend is a software library and a collection of scripts. Its interface includes
        calling the library functions, running the scripts, and querying/writing to a central
        database.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's responsible for communicating with the satellites and automating operations
        through task scheduling.
