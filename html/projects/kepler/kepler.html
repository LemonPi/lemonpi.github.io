<p>For 12 weeks during the summer of 2018
I worked at <a href="http://www.keplercommunications.com/">Kepler Communications</a>
as a software engineering intern.</p>
<p>I designed and implemented the mission control software backend
to replace a third party solution which was not scalable and had usability issues.</p>

<ul>
<li>satellite - orbiting around Earth</li>
<li>ground stations - giant antennas around Earth that physically transmit and receive</li>
<li>operations computer (ops) - computer(s) managing operations that handles information to
and from multiple ground stations</li>
</ul>

<p>Kepler works with low earth orbit satellites that orbit around Earth very quickly.
Communication is only possible when they're visible to a ground station, usually
lasting around 10 minutes each with many hour gaps in between.
These opportunities are called <strong>passes</strong>.</p>
<p>The link quality increases as the altitude of the satellite relative to the ground
station increases, up to a maximum in the middle of the pass. Packets are frequently
lost, especially when the altitude is low.</p>

                               name="mcs_backend">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The MCS backend is a software library and a collection of scripts. Its interface includes
calling the library functions, running the scripts, and querying/writing to a central
database.</p>
<p>It's responsible for communicating with the satellites and automating operations
through task scheduling.</p>

                               name="features">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Scalable to many satellites and ops machines</li>
<li>Flexible in choosing communication protocol on a per satellite basis</li>
<li>Task scheduling and resumption across passes</li>
</ul>
