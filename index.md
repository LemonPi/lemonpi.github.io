Take a look around my engineering design portfolio,  
where I present my [engineering design philosophy](principles.html)
and showcase [projects](projects/) and [evaluations](evaluations/).  

Or, if you're interested in the site itself, visit [here](projects/portfolio/)

##Professional Statement
> ###As an engineer,
> I believe engineering design is the application of scientific knowledge to solve real problems in a robust, usable, and efficient manner with the stakeholders in mind.  
> My strengths lie in learning new tools and applying scientific knowledge to analyze real life situations.  
> An area of improvement for me is finding a balance between iterating through prototypes and exploring their details -  
> as of now, I spend too much time fine tuning the details than testing the feasibility of the details.  
>
> My engineering process is cyclically applied to and refined through each project, thus my latest projects  
> should accurately embody my process to date.  
> Some recent projects: [CDR: Binder Misalignment](projects/binder/) | [Engineering Portfolio](projects/portfolio/) | [CIV 102 Truss Bridge Design](projects/bridgedesign/)
