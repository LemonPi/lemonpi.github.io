This is my engineering design portfolio,  
where I present my [engineering design philosophy](principles.html)
and showcase [projects](projects/) and [evaluations](evaluations/).

##Professional Statement
> ###As an engineer,
> I believe engineering design is applying scientific knowledge to solve real problems in a robust, usable, with the stakeholders in mind.  
> My strengths lie in applying scientific knowledge to analyze real life situations, and quickly learning new tools.  
> An area of improvement for me is finding a balance between iterating through prototypes and researching details -  
> As of now, I spend too much time fine tuning the details than physically testing.  
> My engineering design process is continuously applied to and refined through each project;  
> Some recent projects: [CDR: Binder Misalignment](projects/binder/) | [Engineering Portfolio](projects/portfolio/) | [CIV 102 Matboard Bridge](projects/bridgebuild/)
