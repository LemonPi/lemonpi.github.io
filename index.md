<h1 class="inline">Hi Googler!</h1><p class="inline">&nbsp;&nbsp;(I'll write about how I could tell later)</p>
<p>
	I missed the instruction to put my essays in the cover letter section so here they are:
	<br>
</p>
<p>
	<b>Interest in computer science</b><br>
	Computer science to me is the essential tool to implement solutions to almost all problems. Solving problems is what I enjoy most, and programming lets me implement solutions from theory and share it for others to use. One problem I tackled and am working on is people’s inability to estimate how long it takes to do something. My roommate and I built <b><a href="http://timewatch.ca">Timewatch</a></b>, a web app that gives people distribution graphs of how long a searched activity would take. It collects data by crawling open databases and through user input. 
</p>
<p>
	Behind the scenes is a lot of language processing to determine whether a huge database contains time-relevant data and to convert from various formats (elapsed time, start-end dates, and foreign formats). In further explore language processing, I built a small (600 lines of C++) and efficient <b><a href="projects/clisp">Lisp interpreter</a></b>, and a grammar based <b><a href="projects/bincalc">calculator</a></b> using an elegant recursive-descent model. I strongly believe that good solutions need to be usable and accessible, so I cross compiled them to Javascript so that they can be used by anyone with a web-browser by visiting my website. I hope my education will help me solve more such problems in better ways.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Application motivation</b><br>
	The prospect of interning at Google really excites me because of how well my interests align with Google's forte in language processing and search-based services. There is much for me to learn in this area, and learning through a summer of Engineering Practicum at the leader in this field will make sure I learn it right and learn it fast. Of particular interest to me is how Google scales its services so effectively through distribution and highly sophisticated algorithms. 
</p>

<p>
	<b>Need for diversity</b><br>
	Diversity in society’s problem solvers is greatly beneficial to humanity’s collective ability to solve problems. As I mentioned above, computer science is essential to implementing solutions out of theory, so many problem solvers are pursuing computer science degrees.
</p>
<p>
	I subscribe to the theory of <b><a href="http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3708468/Weitzman_RecombinantGrowth.pdf?sequence=2">recombinant growth</a></b>, that most of growth is the product of creating solutions by combining existing solutions in new ways. If everyone had the same experience and background, then the ways society would combine solutions would be very limited. Thus diversity in our problem solvers is important so that problems are looked at from multiple perspectives, leading to more valuable combinations of solutions. This model of growth is supported by the success of crowdsourced problem solving through sites such as <b><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a></b>, <b><a href="http://www.innocentive.com">InnoCentive</a></b> and <b><a href="http://mashable.com">Mashable</a></b>. For example, Kaggle’s <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/asap-aes">Automated Student Assessment Prize</a> for automated scoring of essays was won by an independent team that had no prior experience competing against established corporations in the field.
</p>
<p>
	Problem solving requires creativity and interdisciplinary thinking, in addition to expertise, and that is why diversity in our problem solvers is essential to accelerate society’s rate of progress.

##Professional Statement
> ###As an engineer,
> I believe engineering design is the iterative application of scientific knowledge and technical skills to solve real problems in a robust, usable, and efficient manner with the stakeholders in mind.
  

> Good engineering is a balance of fitting theoretical models and trial and error through prototyping,  
> and it often involves breaking down the problem and inventing a language of tools at each layer for a long-lasting, robust solution.

> As you consider my exploits from past to present, you can see evidence of how I progressed from oversimplifying problems to appreciating complex issues.  

> My personal strengths lie in adopting new tools and applying scientific knowledge to analyze real life situations.
