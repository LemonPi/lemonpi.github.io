##Professional Statement
> ###As an engineer,
> I believe engineering design is the iterative application of scientific knowledge and technical skills to solve real problems in a robust, usable, and efficient manner with the stakeholders in mind.
  

> Good engineering is a balance of fitting theoretical models and trial and error through prototyping,  
> and it often involves breaking down the problem and inventing a language of tools at each layer for a long-lasting, robust solution.

> As you consider my exploits from past to present, you can see evidence of how I progressed from oversimplifying problems to appreciating complex issues.  

> My personal strengths lie in adopting new tools and applying scientific knowledge to analyze real life situations.
