##Professional Statement
> ###As an engineer,
> I believe engineering design is the application of scientific knowledge to solve real problems in a robust, usable, and efficient manner with the stakeholders in mind.  
> Good engineering is a balance of fitting theoretical models and trial and error through prototyping.  
> As you consider my exploits from past to present, you can see evidence of how I progressed from oversimplifying problems to appreciating complex issues.  
> My personal strengths lie in adopting new tools and applying scientific knowledge to analyze real life situations.
