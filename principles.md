My vision of good engineering design should seek these objectives in order of importance: 
robustness, usability, and efficiency.  


> ###*Robust* solutions are designed for real life, where the environment is constantly changing.  
> Designing for robustness often involves making the product simple (less parts often means less susceptible to noise).  
> It also involves making the product easily changeable, which I implement by building the solution out of **modules**.  
> This requires clearly defining how each module/component interact, which then allows the change of  
> one component without requiring the change of other components as long as the interface is kept the same.  
> My [engineering process](/portfolio/process.html) is geared towards robustness by first breaking the problem into components,  
> creating a solution/module for each part, then combining and refining them to provide what best suits the current context.  

> ###*Usable* solutions are designed for the end users, who possess a various set of skills and perspectives.  
> Designing for usability often involves changing perspectives (reframing), and considering what would be intuitive for the users.  
> It requires attention to detail to provide a quality user experience.  
> The more physical aspect of usability is ergonomics - making the product physically compatible with human users.  
> This involves research into human factors and designing the physical properties with those factors in mind.

> ###*Efficient* solutions are designed for progress, which involves solving large problems with little resources.  
> Designing for efficiency often involves refining and iterating through solutions. My engineering process emphasizes  
> maintaining a solution pool and keeping the selection open partly for this purpose. Retaining possible component solutions  
> encourages iteration through various combinations to find a **balance between efficiency and robustness**.
