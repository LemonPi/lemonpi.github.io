My vision of good engineering design should seek these objectives in order of importance:

<table id="pretty">
<tr>
  <th>Objective</th>
  <th>Explanation</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Robust</td>
  <td>The product should function under many different contexts and adapt or at least endure change</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Usable</td>
  <td>The user needs to easily use the product, so make it simple and intuitive</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Efficient</td>
  <td>Solving a problem using less resources means lowering the cost of the solution and making it accessible to more people</td>
</tr>
</table>
