My vision of good engineering design should seek these objectives in order of importance:

<table class="pretty">
<tr>
  <th>Objective</th>
  <th>Explanation</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Robustness</td>
  <td>The product should function under many different contexts and adapt to or at least endure change</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Usability</td>
  <td>The user needs to easily use the product, so make it simple and intuitive</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Efficiency</td>
  <td>Solving a problem using less resources means lowering the cost of the solution and making it accessible to more people</td>
</tr>
</table>


> ###*Robust* solutions are designed for real life, where the environment is constantly changing.  
> Designing for robustness often involves making the product simple (less parts often means less susceptible to noise).  
> It also involves making the product easily changeable, which I implement by building the solution out of **modules**.  
> This requires clearly defining how each module/component interact, which then allows the change of  
> one component without requiring the change of other components as long as the interface is kept the same.  
> My [engineering process](/portfolio/process.html) is geared towards robustness by first breaking the problem into components,  
> creating a solution/module for each part, then combining and refining them to provide what best suits the current context.  

> ###*Usable* solutions are designed for the end users, who possess a different set of skills and perspectives.  
> Designing for usability often involves changing perspectives (reframing), and considering what would be intuitive  
> for the users. The other aspect of usability is ergonomics - making the product physically compatible with human users.  
> This involves research into human factors and designing the physical properties with those factors in mind.  

> ###*Efficient* solutions are designed for progress, which involves solving large problems with little resources.  
> Designing for efficiency often involves refining and iterating through solutions. My engineering process emphasizes  
> maintaining a solution pool and keeping the selection open partly for this purpose. Retaining possible component solutions  
> encourages iteration through various combinations to find a **balance between efficiency and robustness**.
