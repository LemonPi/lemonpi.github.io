When I solve a problem, this is what I do:

 - Use intuition to recognize patterns and use functional decomposition to break problem down
   - Need to move something? Consider what forces can be used and what can provide those forces
   - Need to fold something? Consider whether to buckle or bend
 - Think of specialized solutions for each of the problem components (monomaniacal design)
 - Compare solutions based on my [principles](/principles.html), adjusted for what the context demands
   - Combine component solutions
 - Prototype 
 - Refine
   - Can one part perform multiple functions?
   - Can two parts be combined into one?
   - How will the user interact with it?
   - How will it be stored and cleaned?
