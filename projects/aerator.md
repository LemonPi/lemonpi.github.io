title: Detailed Design - Material Selection for Aerator

For this project, I was subcontracted to explore the material selection for an aerator  
that is meant to prevent splashing when liquid is transferred between containers.  

The full report can be found [**here**](detaileddesign.pdf).

This project was a departure from previous ones where I conceptually designed a solution  
where in this one I had to focus on a single aspect of the solution.  

Much of my effort went towards research for metrics that accurately reflected the objectives the design team  
contracted to me and ones that I added for additional value.  

This research gave me greater appreciation of the nuances that need to be considered,  
such as hardness and smoothness of the material when designing for hygiene

-----------------------
- Principles: designing for usability of consumer goods need to be hygienic  
and possible metrics are roughness average (micrometer) and hardness (HV)
- Research experience
- Material knowledge of stainless steels
