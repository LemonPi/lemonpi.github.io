<p>
	A request for proposal (RFP) looking at the discomfort of wearing headsets and glasses,
	especially for Toronto Police communication operators who must wear them for 8 hours straight.
</p>
<p>
	Full RFP <a href="headsetandglasses.pdf">here</a>
</p>
<p>
	I was responsible for the introduction sections, most of the requirements, most of the editing, and creating all the visuals.

<h2 class="anchor">Problem Overview <a class="anchor-link" title="permalink to section" href="#overview" name="overview">¶</a></h2>
-------------------------
<div class="text-block">
	My entire class was tasked with finding an interesting community that could use
	our help to improve their lived experience. I chose the communication operators because the department
</div>

 - has a clear hierarchy and access point so engaging with them is straightforward  
 - has a history of endorsing ergonomic centred design for their workers  
 - faces increasing number of calls with declining number of operators  
 - has a unconventional shift schedule that introduces lots of opportunities for improvement  
 - potential problems are likely mechanical and thus are approachable for first year engineering students

<p>
	My team agreed with my points and selected this community in favour of three other ones.
</p>
<p>
	We distributed tasks such that I was responsible for contacting the community and researching community details.
	I eventually secured a visit to the Public Safety Answering Point (call center) after many emails, calls, and a background check -
	more hassle for contact than I anticipated!
</p>
<p>
	At the call center, Kim noticed and suggested we investigate the discomfort of wearing
	headsets and glasses together, as operators must wear them for 8 continuous hours.
	When asked, most operators confirmed the discomfort and that they had to contacts or 
	change glasses because of it, which caused problems of itself.
</p>
<p>
	I believe this problem is highly suitable for us to explore because it
</p>
</div>

 - provides room for diverse solutions
 - is a small mechanical problem that could be solved with first year engineering science knowledge
 - is very expandable in scope -> solution could be useful for anyone who wears glasses and headsets

	The requirements is the most important section of any RFP and also the difficult to get right.
	Good requirements can only come after the problem has been well understood in <b>physical</b> (forces),
	<b>logistical</b> (what resources are avaible or not), and <b>social</b> (how does the social environment influence the problem) 
	terms. In an RFP, this understanding partially frames the problem and should be presented first in the RFP, 
	embedded in the abstract, introduction (in our case community details), problem definition, and stakeholder explanation.
</p>
<p>
	After the full understanding, high level objectives can be formed, which then each branch out into 
	detailed objectives that can be more directly measured. I was responsible for finding metrics and constraints 
	for our RFP, and it was very time and research intensive, but rewarding. Below is our high level objectives 
	and the table of detailed objectives.
</p>
</div>
 1. Must reduce or eliminate discomfort caused by wearing glasses together with headsets for all operators wearing glasses.  
 2.	Must not hinder any operators from performing their task.  
 3.	Should be compatible with existing equipment and budgets.

<p>
	As you can see, the requirements are very comprehensive and relevant to this problem.
	However, our RFP was not selected as one of the 8 RFPs to give out to teams 
	to pursue solutions. I believe this is because of the difficulty in measuring
	decibles (dB), which was included in a lot of metrics.
	This illustrates that strong requirements are ones that are <b>comprehensive, relevant, and
	easy to measure</b>. 
</p>
<p>
	The clearest area of improvement if we had more time is to specify a 
	standard procedure for testing candidate solutions. In the current state,
	different teams could use drastically different means to measure for sound quality 
	and the results would be unreliable to the point of being useless.
