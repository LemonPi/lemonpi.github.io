        <p>Hi, my name is Johnson, the son of my father, John. My Chinese name is Zhong Sheng (钟盛) which is pronounced similarly.</p>
        <p>I received my PhD in Robotics advised by <a href="https://berenson.robotics.umich.edu/">Dmitry Berenson</a> 
and co-advised by <a href="https://www.mmintlab.com/people/nima-fazeli/">Nima Fazeli</a> at the University of Michigan.
I previously received my B.ASc. in Engineering Science from the University of Toronto.
        </p>
        <p>I am interested in using model-based methods to reason about uncertainty for robot manipulation, with the
       goal of enabling robots in homes. I also develop <a href="https://github.com/lemonpi">open source software</a>
       for robotics research, focusing on parallelization and performance.
        </p>
